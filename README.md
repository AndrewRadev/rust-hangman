## Hangman

A simple game of "hangman" to use for demonstrations in the rust programming course in Sofia U.

You can install the game locally with `cargo install`. After that, as long as your `~/.cargo/bin` directory is in your `PATH`, run `hangman --help` to get information on how to start it with a list of words.

Once it's started, you'll get a prompt, where you can enter commands. Try the `help` command for information on what you can do.
